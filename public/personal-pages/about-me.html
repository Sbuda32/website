                gaining experience for both front and back end frameworks. I am excellent in
                working with others to achieve a certain objective on time and with excellence.
                <br><br>

                I have also worked in the feild of electronics as an auto electrician
                for over 2 years, with this mention, i love problem solving, building new
                things, repairing stuff, and i like to see everything work.
